## Project Description:

Our project aims to create an interactive dashboard application that will analyze the spatial relationship between transportation availability, income level, and corresponding healthcare accessibility. Through the dashboard, we will be able to visualize the disparities between transportation and healthcare in the mode of transportation accessibility and costs. An article highlighting the need for greater investment in public transportation highlights how “our road conditions are consistently ranked among the worst in the nation. Traffic jams abound. Major bridges are either out of commission or face deferred maintenance.” (Kidde, 2021). The need to improve transportation infrastructure fundamentally affects how people who rely on public transit are able to commute to important areas, such as hospitals. While transportation investments are crucial, we plan on taking a multifaceted approach which looks at other systematic issues relating to healthcare accessibility, such as the income spent on transportation and corresponding transit stops and hospital locations.
